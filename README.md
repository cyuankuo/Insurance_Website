# Insurance_Website

This is a webpage designed for CS-GY 6083 Principles of Database Systems as a final project.

The webpage requires a user to login to the site in order to access the relevant functions.

Employees are able to login to the site and create new customer credentials, register new customer, edit and update all the data of the customers and policy.
In short, the employee is able to view the relevant data he or she desires.

The customer login is more simple as no authorization should be given to customers for data integrity purposes.
Customers are only allowed to view the current data relevant to their policy.

// For testing purposes, this version of the code contains only the unhashed password.
